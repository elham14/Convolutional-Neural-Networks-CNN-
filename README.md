## Introduction 
In this project, I'll create a deep learning model to perform on the MNIST handwritten dataset nearly at the cutting edge. I'll combine Keras and TensorFlow.

### MNIST Dataset
The National Institute of Standards and Technology provided many datasets of scanned documents, which were used to create this dataset (NIST). The size and centering of these pictures were adjusted. Each picture measures 28x28 pixels (784 pixels). An algorithm was trained on 60,000 photos, and then tested on 10,000. The prediction error is 1% for excellent outcomes. With a large convolutional neural network, it is possible to reach state-of-the-art results of about 0.2%.
